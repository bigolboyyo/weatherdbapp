# Weather App

## Intro

Hello, World! This is my very first single page application.
This app was made as a simple way to express my front-end development knowledge thus far.

## How To Use

Use the Live Server extension in VSCODE and open up the HTML file.
[Live Server Setup](https://www.worldofitech.com/visual-studio-code-live-server/)

On the webpage you will see a simple search bar. Type in a location to append a weather card to the page.
This weather card has a backside where one can take notes. Append as many cards as you'd like!

### Epilogue

Thanks for checking out my first solo project. Although it is simplistic, the journey to this point has been nothing short of life changing.
