Project Pitches
Before you start working on your project, 
 you'll pitch your project idea to your instructors for approval and feedback.

For your project pitch, you should include:

-The basic story of your application
-The core features of your MVP
-The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
-Challenges you expect to face
-How you are meeting the requirements of the project
-Feel free to send this pitch to your instructor via slack asynchronously.
